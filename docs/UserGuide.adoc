== Welcome to CodeCampX
Code Camp X (CCX) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage the administrative tasks of running a coding camp*.
More importantly, CCX is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CCX can allow you to manage your camp's administrative tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== Legend
The following *3* callouts will be used throughout the documentation which you may wish to pay attention to as it may
contain important details:

[NOTE]
Just for your info, do not be alarmed. Be sure to read these notes as it might contain some important information.

[TIP]
Perhaps something can be done using another approach, but it is up to you to decide. Tips are often not important and
can be safely ignored.

[WARNING]
Some things might go wrong if you are not careful, or did not follow the instructions correctly. You are strongly
advised to read whatever is in this block.

[[user-interface]]
=== A Quick Look at CodeCampX

*CodeCampX*’s user interface is split into a few sections. These sections are highlighted in the image below.

.Quick Overview of CodeCampX.

* You may install the current version of Java link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here].
====

.  Download the latest version link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* **`help`** : Opens up the help page
* *`exit`* : Exits the application

.  Refer to <<Commands>> for details of each command.

[[Components]]
== Components
*CodeCampX* consists of five core components: Students, Staffs, Courses, Finances, Assignments

=== Students
You can manage the students by assigning them to courses, and ensuring that they have paid for their courses.

=== Staffs
You can manage the staffs by providing information such as the phone number and email address.
This is critical as staffs are the main point of contact during an emergency. You can keep track
of which teacher staffs you have paid for teaching a course by checking via Finances.

=== Courses
You can keep track of the ongoing courses in your Coding Camp. Each course will have an assigned teacher,
as well as a list of assigned students. The course fee should also be specified.

=== Finances
The built-in Sales Management component in CodeCampX provides you with the tools you will need to keep track of financial
records efficiently. Several analytical features are also incorporated to assist you in financial decision-making
and devising marketing strategies.

=== Assignments
You can keep track of the available assignments of the various students or courses through this functionality. Additionally,
the progress of the assignments can be viewed for the course of the student (In Student Tab)
or the student of a course (In Course Tab).

[[Features]]
== Key Features
=== Convenience
*CodeCampX* is an integrated application that will provide you with the utmost convenience and tools you will need to
manage your Coding Camps. It allows you to:

* Export data to `.json` (default) or Excel file `[coming in v2.0]`.

=== Security
We understand that digital security is your biggest concern. *CodeCampX* is capable of securing your restaurants' data by:

* Encrypting all data using state of the art encryption scheme `[coming in v2.0]`.
* Providing accountability through logging of system events.

=== Efficiency
Time is money. *CodeCampX* ensures that the application will:

* Load within 5 seconds.
* Execute commands within split of a second and update the GUI almost instantaneously.

[[Commands]]
== Commands
*CodeCampX* is jam-packed with features and it may be daunting for new users. The subsequent sections of the user guide
provides a step by step walk-through of all the commands *CodeCampX* has to offer.

Do read our short explanation about Command Format below so that the subsequent portions of this section will make sense to you.
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add-student n/STUDENT_NAME`, `STUDENT_NAME` is a
parameter which can be used as `add-student n/Bob`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/STUDENT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bob t/loyal` or as `n/Bob`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as
`{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/loyal`, `t/10years t/new` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `cid/COURSE_ID tid/TEACHER_ID`, `tid/TEACHER_ID cid/COURSE_ID`
is also acceptable.
====

=== General
The commands in this section does not tie to any of the 5 components.

==== Viewing help : `help`
Opens up the help window. Very useful if you are a new user. +
Format: `help`

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`


==== Undo Command: `undo`

Set the app state back to the most recent undoableCommand.

[NOTE]
======
See the full list of undoable commands: all edit/add/delete/assign/unassign/done/undone commands.
======

Examples:

* `find-student hieu` +
`undo`

This will fail because `find-student` is not an undoableCommand.

* `delete-student 35853` +
`undo`

Undo the delete command of student and add the student back at the previous relative ordering too.

Illustration:

image::undo_1.PNG[]

After `delete-student 35853`

image::undo_2.PNG[]

After `undo`:

image::undo_3.png[]

==== Redo Command: `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command, but will fail if the most recent command was not the `undo` command or `redo`
command

Examples:

* `delete-student 35853` +
`undo` +
`redo`

Successfully delete the student, then add the student back with `undo`, then delete student again with `redo`

* `find-student hieu` +
`redo`

`redo` fails because no `undo` command previously

* `delete-student 35853` +
`undo` +
`find-student hieu` +
`redo`

This `redo` also fails because the most recent command is not `undo` or `redo`


Format: `undo` or `redo`

If you edit a salary of a Teacher Staff, all the Finance associated with him still *remain the same*. This is because
a Finance is added based on the salary of a Teacher at that moment and it records the transaction made. If a Teacher Staff's salary
is edited (for example: increased), it means this Teacher's salary base is increased and it has nothing to do with the Finances that has been made.

To summarise, all three types requires ft/FINANCETYPE and d/DATE to be specified. +
Type 1 additionally requires n/FINANCE-NAME a/AMOUNT +
Type 2 additionally requires cid/COURSEID sid/STUDENTID +
Type 3 additionally requires cid/COURSEID tid/TEACHERID +

[TIP]
====
For Type 1 miscellaneous transactions, you can specify the amount as negative(with a "-" in front) or
positive(without a "-" in front) For example, a/100 or a/-100

For Type 2 student paying for a course, the amount will be positive automatically, as it is an earning

For Type 3 teacher being paid for teaching a course, the amount will be negative automatically, as it is an expense

To make Payment for a teacher, it is important to check the salary value of the teacher. This value is set to 0 by default
when adding a new staff (teacher) if the user does not specify salary. A result of payment with amount 0 will be added if the
salary of the teacher is 0.

The positive and negative amount is important (for miscellaneous type) as it is used under "earnings" and "expenses" commands.
