== PROJECT: Code Camp X

---

== Overview

Code Camp X (CCX) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage the administrative tasks of running a coding camp. More importantly, CCX is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CCX can allow you to manage your campâ€™s administrative tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

In the document below, the *four main features* refers to Student, Staff, Course and Finance

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added initial code base for the *four main features*
** Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/46[#46]
** What it does: implemented the major functionality needed for each of the *four main features*.
This includes the fields needed for each features such as ID and course fee amount, Add, Delete, Edit, Clear, Find, List.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the initial code base allows us to work on each of our
own assigned features with fewer code conflicts.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the commands to be added in the future, hence it sets the initial
code base needed for future features to be built upon. This implementation is especially challenging,
because alternative design implementations need to be considered, and numerous commands are added to the application.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the GUI alone* over *three* iterations
** Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/45[#45](First iteration), https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/73/commits[#73](Second iteration),
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/117[#117](Third iteration)
** First iteration: added four different *tabs* to the GUI, displaying Student, Staff, Course and Finance
** Second iteration: updated the GUI to look like our initial mock-up. Changed color schemes and added Summary Panel
** Third iteration: revamped the GUI by improving the color schemes further. Added sub-panels in each tab.
For example, the Student tab now has an additional selected Student panel, along with a panel showing the list of courses assigned to the student.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can see clearly the effects of the changes made in the GUI
This implementation is especially challenging, because of the amount of effort taken to plan how the GUI should look like,
and ensuring that the GUI is suitable for every member of the team.
** Highlights: This enhancement also supports the clicking of the GUI. For example, the Student bar can be clicked to show the list of course assigned to the student. Every GUI interaction can be be replicated using a CLI command.

* *Major enhancement*: added assigning commands (which forms the crux of designing our application) for the *four main features*
** Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/81[#81], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/91[#91]
** What it does: allows the assigning of students/teachers/assignments to courses
This includes the GUI support mentioned in the previous section. For example, as students can be assigned to a course,
each course will have a list of students. This must be supported by the GUI as well, where the course tab
will display the list of students assigned to the selected course.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because assigning of the various items
is the most important part of our application. This implementation is especially challenging, as the design implementation
needs to be considered carefully due to the large amount of potential one-to-one relationships. After the discussion
with the team about the code structure, I implemented the assigning commands.
** Highlights: This enhancement is tedious, due to the potential of bugs appearing. The design
implementation must be considered carefully. For example, when the user deletes an assignment, the assignment
should be removed from every course that the assignment is assigned to. Also, the assignment
must be removed from every student that is taking a course with this assignment. As can be seen,
the user commands will cuase significant changes to the relationships among the *four main features*,
which have to each to notified of the changes made. The GUI must also be updated
automatically when the user performs the command, in every tabs.
* *Minor enhancement*: added the support of a summary panel which displays the overall statistics of the coding camp
* *Minor enhancement*: added a quick navigation command that allows the user to switch between different tabs quickly (Select command and CTRL+UP/DOWN shortcuts)
* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

List of commands tested by me(Checked that it actually saved, undo/redo works for these commands, and whether GUI auto-updates):
all add, edit, delete, assign, unassign, find, list, switch, clear-all commands
