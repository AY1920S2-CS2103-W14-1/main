== PROJECT: Code Camp X

== Overview

Code Camp X (CCX) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage the administrative tasks of running a coding camp.
More importantly, CCX is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CCX can allow you to manage your campâ€™s administrative tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented Code Base for `Assignment` and `Progress`
** What it does: This allows the user to add `Assignments`, with a name and deadline into the program.
This also allowed for future extension where a `Progress` object can be created to tie a `Student` and `Assignment` together.
** Justification: This allows the users to track all the `Assignments` that is in the camp and will help in the implementation of
tracking student progress in the subsequent extension.
** Highlights:
*** An in-depth analysis was required to determine if `Progress` was really required since
it takes up a lot of time to successfully add another `AddressBookGeneric` into the program, while taking into account the UI, the storage
the commands, parsers, etc. However, the group decided that by splitting the logic of `Assignment` and `Progress`, this will
allow for better usability and testability. This was discussed within the Developer's Guide as well.
*** Another highlight is that I needed to implement a special form of ID, which I call `CompositeID`, just for `Progress` object, since `Progress` objects
are identified by 2 IDs, studentID and assignmentID. Due to this, I needed to implement many methods in `ModelManager` in order
to allow for model handling via this `compositeID`.


* *Major enhancement*: Implemented all *Undo/Redo-able* `Assign` & `Un-assign` commands
** What it does: Allow user to assign/un-assign a `Student`/`Teacher`/`Assignment` to a `Course` and allow for them to undo/redo those commands
** Justification:
... This allows the user add/remove a student/teacher/assignment to and from a course, allowing for them to better manage the
their coding camp.
... Should they have executed the command wrongly, they are able to undo or redo the commands they have just executed
while returning to the *correct* previous state.
** Highlights:
This was one of the most challenging portions of the program due to these reasons:
. It ties in many of the functionality and classes implemented.
For example, the Assign/Un-assign commands need to make sure that entity linking is *correct* and that `Progress` objects added/removed *correctly*.
As such, it is very dependent on `EdgeManager` and `ProgressManager` for correct implementation.
. Many design alternatives were considered. Initially, the logic of assigning the edges was within the `Assign`/`Un-assign` command itself,
but I refactored everything out to the `ModelManager` and subsequently `EdgeManager` to ensure that we better follow design principle of `Single-Responsibility Principle`.
. Pre-processing of Command was *vital* since our program works via IDs. The method is crucial in making sure that the entities
are in a `consistent state` before executing the assign command. `Consistent state` means that either the two targeting objects have
each other's IDs or they do not. There should never be the case where one party has the other's ID but not vice versa.
. Allow for Undo/Redo-ability into the *correct* state
.. Generally, when undo/redo is called, we just have to execute the opposite command.
.. However, we realized that it was not so trivial when we discovered a huge bug where undo-ing an un-assign command
does not put back the specific `Progress` objects that were removed.
.. As such, special considerations had to be implemented to ensure that these `Assign`/`Un-assign` commands can work correctly.
.. These considerations are included in the Developer's Guide as well.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented ProgressManager to allow for successful Creation/Deletion of `Progress objects
* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented Assign/Un-assign portion of EdgeManager
* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented Done/Undone Commands to mark Progress objects as `Done`/`Undone`
