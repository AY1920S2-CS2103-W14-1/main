[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture [Hieu]

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureNewDiagram.png[]
---

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

==== Design Pattern and Control Flow

Two main design patterns were used in the design of our software.

Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM) Control Flow::

Design Consideration between Model-View-Controller(MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) design:

- The original design was a standard MVC, where Controller is our LogicManager, and the Model is our ModelManager.
Then components in the view will bind to the model objects, whenever there is an update to the model object the UI view will be updated automatically.

- However, the more UI custom views logic we decide, we might need to push more and more custom UI-specific logic to our Model and ViewController class, which is not very desirable.
Or as the infamous quote, MVC becomes "Massive View Controller".

- Instead, we will adapt to MVVM design, where ViewModel will hold a list of observableMap of data.
Each custom view in our UI will have a one-to-one mapping with an observableMap, and to calculate those observableMap the ViewModel will make use of the Managers we define.

Event-Driven Design::

We adopt event-driven design, where different components will try to communicate with each other through publishing events and subscribing to events, de-couple between components, and facilitate communication between components a lot.

** To separate responsibilities well between components, we divide them into multiple managers, all extending from the BaseManager class.
The BaseManager will always hold refer to the EventsCenter (which is designed to be a singleton class in our case)

*** One is publishing managers (those in Model section, i.e EdgeManager, ProgressManager, etc).
They can post events to the EventsCenterSingleton.

*** The other one is subscribing managers, one is the ViewModel (which is DetailManager) and StorageManager.
Subscribing managers will have handler method that listen to the events and decide what to do.

** Different events types will extend from the BaseEvent.
In our app we have

- DataStorageChangeEvent: signals when model object changes

- DeleteEntitySyncEvent: signals when the entity linking relationship is broken (e.g when a student is deleted, its link to course and progress and teacher, etc will be broken)

Here is an example of how a command to delete student with ID 1 will invoke different parts along the flow.

.Sequence Diagram for Events Flow
image::EventsFlowDiagram.png[]
---

. ViewController(i.e LogicManager) will invoke ModelManager.delete method (Note that ModelManager extends from BaseManager, and has the Publisher capacity)
. ModelManager will invoke publishing of events to EventsCenterSingleton (which holds an EventBus), in this case postDataStorageChangeEvent and postDeleteEntitySyncEvent will be invoked.
. Other BaseManagers will also hold this EventsCenterSingleton and listen to new publish events in the event bus.
If the manager class has the handler function for that types of events, the method will be invoked.
. In this case, StorageManager will have handler for both DataStorageChangeEvent and DeleteEntitySyncEvent, while ViewModel will have handler for DataStorageChangeEvent.

==== Architecture-Level Components

Overall, the App consists of five main components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`View`*>>: The UI of the App.
Represented by `UI` in our implementation.
* <<Design-Logic,*`ViewController`*>>: The command executor.
Represented by `Logic` in our implementation.
* <<Design-Storage,*`ViewModel`*>>: Updates the model for UI to display.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

In addition, <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command

// tag::xue1[]
The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== View/UI component [Sim Sheng Xue]

.Structure of the UI Component
image::ViewUI.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `ViewController` component.
* Listens for changes to `ViewModel` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
`ListPanel` objects store a list of `Card` objects. +
`DetailedPanel` objects store a list of `VeryDetailedCard` objects.
For example, for the Student Tab:  +

The `StudentListPanel` is the top left panel. This stores a list of `StudentCard`,
which only displays the basic information about the Student. +

The `StudentDetailedCard` is the top right panel. This is viewed when a specific
Student is selected using a command. This will show the detailed information about
the Student, such as the courses assigned to this Student. +

The `StudentDetailedPanel` is the bottom
right panel. This stores a list of `CourseVeryDetailedCard`.
Each `CourseVeryDetailedCard` displays the list of assignments assigned
to the Course of this Student. +

Only the Student and Course tabs contain `DetailedPanel`(bottom right panel). All tabs
contain the `ListPanel` (top left panel) and `DetailedCard`(top right panel).
This is because `ListPanel` is needed to show the basic information of each
item, while `DetailedCard` is needed to show the detailed information of each
selected item. `DetailedPanel` is only needed for Student to show list of Courses for a Student,
and for Course to show list of Student for a Course.

. As can be seen from the UI diagram above, each of the `Card`, `DetailedCard` and `VeryDetailedCard`
will subscribe and listen to the `ViewModel` through the logic layers.
. Each of these classes will correspond to the observableMap in `ViewModel`
. When there is a change to the model, the `ViewModel` will update its observableMap
. As each of these classes in `View` subscribe to the `ViewModel`, the UI will update automatically.
// end::xue1[]

// tag::xue2[]
=== ViewController/Logic component [Sim Sheng Xue]

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the View Controller Component
image::ViewController.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `ViewController` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
. The `LogicManager` will invoke the relevant class located inside `Model`.
For Entity CRUD commands, the `ModelManager` will be invoked.
For Link CRUD commands, the `EdgeManager` will be invoked.
For Progress CRUD commands, the `ProgressManager` will be invoked.
. The Managers will post events to the `EventsCenterSingleton`. The subscribing
managers `DetailManager` and `StorageManager` will listen to new publish events in the event bus.
The `View` also subscribes to `DetailManager`. This allows for the commands executed by
the `LogicManager` to moify both the View and Storage.
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `View`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `View` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

// end::xue2[]
[[Design-ViewController]]
=== ViewModel component [Hieu]
image::ViewModelDiagram.png[]
---

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/viewmodel/ViewModel.java[`ViewModel.java`]

The `ViewModel`,

* stores a list of `observableMap`, each map will corresponds to one `DetailPanel` in ui folder.
* Each `DetailPanel` (in MainWindow) will listen to the `ViewModel` through the Logic layer.
* the `ViewModel` will then query the managers from `Model` layer to update its
observableMap, which in turn will automatically update the corresponding `DetailPanel` view.

// tag::modelcomponent[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component [Tee Jun Jie Ivan]

.Structure of the Model Component
image::Ivan-ModelClassDiagram.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the 6 AddressBookGeneric<K extends ModelObject>, each of which holds a different type of ModelObject.
The 6 types are namely
. Student
. Course
. Staff
. Assignment
. Progress
. Finance
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<K extends ModelObject>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other components.

Below is an example of the different types of RelevantFields that can be tied to an Assignment.

.Class Diagram of Assignment
image::Ivan-AssignmentClassDiagram.png[%autowidth]

[NOTE]
The AddressBookGeneric in the diagram above is actually an AddressBookGeneric<Assignment>.
The AddressBookGeneric has been made to accept any class that extends ModelObject.
This cannot be shown due to limitations in PlantUML.

==== Notable Implementations in Model
. By making use of `Generics` and `Polymorphism`, the group has made it such that `AddressBookGeneric<K extends ModelObject>` can hold any class that extends from ModelObject
Benefits::
.. Allows for code optimization by having reusable code.
There is significant decrease in workload when code can be reused for each others' benefit instead of having duplicated code.
.. Allows for extension easily for future features.
Future features that involve creating new AddressBooks can be developed very quickly and allow for faster development of future features.

. All `ModelObjects` implement `Cloneable` so as to allow for Defensive Programming more easily.
.. Please refer to <<Design-Assign-Copy, `Step 2 of Section 2.2.2`>> for the team's rationale behind having ModelObject implement Cloneable.

. All Non-Crud Commands such as `Assign`/`Un-assign`/`Done` are handled in `DiffTypesOfManagers` such as `EdgeManager` or
`ProgressManager` instead of having all implementations being done in `ModelManager`
Benefits::
.. Easier implementation since lower level implementations can be abstracted away
.. More decoupling which will lead to be better testability and easier debugging

// end::modelcomponent[]

// tag::xue3[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component [Sim Sheng Xue]

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageComponent.png[]
---

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* The `StorageManager` subscribes to the `EventCenter`. It will listen to
both DataStorageChangeEvent and DeleteEntitySyncEvent. DataStorageChangeEvent occurs
when basic information about each object is changed, except for deletion.
DeleteEntitySyncEvent occurs when an object is deleted, and the storage has to
be update to maintain consistency. For example, when a Course is deleted,
the DeleteEntitySyncEvent will trigger the storage to remove the Course from
every Student assigned to this Course.

// end::xue3[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::xue4[]
=== Unique Identification of Entities [Sim Sheng Xue]
. `UUID Manager` - Ensures ID of all entities are unique, allowing each object to be uniquely identifiable

==== UUID Manager

1. All ModelObjects have their own ID which is generated by UUID manager
2. For Progress objects, the ID is a composite ID of assignmentID and studentID

Consideration: +
Each ModelObjects should have a ID generated that is unique among the entire application, across history.
For example, not only can two Students not have the same ID, but a Student and a Staff cannot have
the same ID. This design consideration is taken due to the existence of Finance. +

The Finance object can represent a Student paying for a Course. When the Student is deleted,
the Finance object is not deleted. This is due to the need to track the Finance of the coding camp,
even though the Student has left the camp(and assuming there is no refund, if not the owner
can delete the Finance object). +

Hence, this means that if the ID is not unique among deleted objects, there may be inconsistent
information located in the Finance objects.

[[entity-linking]]
=== Entity Linking - Assigning/Un-Assigning an Entity to/from a Course [Tee Jun Jie Ivan]

In order to allow the tracking of the students/assignments/teachers that are assigned to a course and vice versa, this required us to implement a structure which allowed us to obtain information from the aforementioned objects, without causing any circular referencing errors.

.Relationship between Entities
image::Ivan-OODMForEntityRS.png[]
---

The group came up with the structure above where we centralize most links around the `Course` object so as for easier management of entity links.

[IMPORTANT]
Notice that `Student` does *not* hold a `Course`, but a set of `CourseIDs`. Hence, there should be an association between `Student` and `ID` instead of `Student` and `Course`.
However, the group found it much more *intuitive* to think of the associations to be from 2 modelObjects rather than to and from IDs.
Every non-directed association between 2 objects ensures that both objects have each other's ID.

The only exception is `Progress` objects which are created via a composite ID of `studentID` and `assignmentID`.
A more detailed explanation of Progress Management is explained in <<progress-management>>.

Entity Linking is managed exclusively by `Edge Manager`

* Ensures that links are maintained/removed properly during assign, un-assign, delete commands
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/manager/EdgeManager.java[`EdgeManager.java`]

==== Execution of Assign/Un-assign Command [Tee Jun Jie Ivan]

For the actual execution of an assign/un-assign command, 2 main steps are performed.

. Pre-process the targeted entities to ensure consistent state - Via `PreprocessUndoCommand` method call
. Add/Remove both object's ID into/from each other - Handled by `EdgeManager`

===== Step 1: Preprocess Entities

====== +++<u>Rationale</u>+++

Firstly, a `pre-processing step` must be performed before executing an undo-able assign/un-assign command to ensure
that all entity links are in correct state before command execution.
This means that either

. Both targeted objects have each other's IDs or
. They do not

There should be no instance where Course has an Assignment/Student/Staff's ID but they do not have the Course's ID or vice versa.

====== +++<u>Current Implementation</u>+++

Below is an activity diagram showing the pre-processing performed for assign commands.
The diagram can be generalized for un-assign commands by checking if the course contains X and vice versa in the second stage instead.

.Activity Diagram of Pre-processing for Assign/Un-assign commands
image::Ivan-PreprocessAssignActivityDiagram.png[]

---
Notice that there are 2 main exit points in the activity diagram.

. The success case is straightforward and will lead to a the program continuing to execute the actual assign/un-assign command.
. For the failure case, should any of the conditions fail, this means that either that the

* specified objects does `not exist`,
* both entities are `already assigned` to each other or,
* most importantly, that the model is in an `inconsistent state` where one entity is assigned to the other but not vice versa.

===== Step 2: Assign IDs via EdgeManager

====== +++<u>Rationale</u>+++

After the necessary checks have been performed, respective IDs need to be added to the targeted course and targeted object in order to ensure correct and consistent assigning of objects.

====== +++<u>Current Implementation</u>+++

Below is a sequence diagram of how EdgeManager adds the IDs to the two objects involved.

.Sequence Diagram of EdgeManager's AssignXtoCourse commands
image::Ivan-SeqDiagEdgeManagerAssignCommand.png[]

---
The flow of an assign command is as follows:

. Obtain a copy of the requested `modelObjects` from `ModelManager`
.. One of which must be a `Course` modelObject, the other being either a `Student`/`Staff`/`Assignment` modelObject
. For object X', add the `courseID` into the assignedCourseIDs in X`
.. For assignments, every assignment can only be assigned to at most *one course*.
Hence, it'll hold just an assignedCourseID instead of a set of Course IDs.
. For Course C', add `X's ID` into assignedXIDs in C'
.. For courses, every course may only have at most *one teacher*.
Hence, course will have an assignedTeacherID instead of a set of Teacher IDs.
. Update the 2 affected models by executing `set(targetObj, editedObj)` in modelManager for both changed modelObjects
. Update the storage by running postDataStorageChangeEvent() - ref to `Figure 2` to understand how storage save is triggered

NOTE: This sequence diagram can be generalized for `un-assign command` as well.
Instead of adding IDs, un-assign will remove each other's ID from the respective objects.

[[Design-Assign-Copy]]
====== +++<u>Design Considerations</u>+++

. Manipulating the `actual` modelObjects by having modelManager#get() return referenced variable of the actual `modelObjectTags`.
Pros::
.. Simpler implementation since any changes to the model will change the actual object directly
.. Faster execution since any changes is done to the actual modelObject
Cons::
.. Might allow for unintentional changes to the actual modelObject
. (Current Implementation) Manipulate a `cloned` modelObject by having modelManager#get() return a copy of actual modelObject.
Pros::
.. Prevents unintentional modifications of the shared object
Cons::
.. Extra processing required.
For example, a method is required to replace the old modelObject with the new model object.
Also, requires all ModelObject classes to implement a clone() method.
.. More memory intensive and can hurt overall program performance.

Overall, the second option was chosen since the program is very dependent on maintaining a `consistent state`, where either 2 modelObjects have each other's ID or they do not.
Some performance can be sacrificed in order to ensure that the links between objects cannot be modified by mistake.

===== Summary of Entity Linking

Overall, in order to ensure successful entity linking, the role that `EdgeManager` plays is crucial.
The table below shows the method calls made to `EdgeManager` during an `Assign`/`Un-assign` command.

.Table Summary of EdgeManager's involvement during Assign/Un-assign Commands

// tag::progressmgmt[]

[[progress-management]]
=== Student Progress Management [Tee Jun Jie Ivan]
The `Progress` of students is managed exclusively by the `ProgressManager` class.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/manager/ProgressManager.java[`ProgressManager.java`]

==== Student Progress Creation/Removal
====== +++<u>Rationale</u>+++

New `Progress` objects must be created in 2 main scenarios.

. If a `Student` has been added to a `Course`, the `Student` will need to complete all `Assignments` that have already been assigned to the `Course`.
. If an `Assignment` has been added to a `Course`, all `Students` currently taking the `Course` must now complete that `Assignment`.

The rationale is similar when un-assigning either `Student` or `Assignment` from a `Course`.
`Progress` objects need to be removed instead.

====== +++<u>Current Implementation</u>+++

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating how the ProgressManager adds Progress objects into the ProgressAddressBook when a `AssignStudentToCourse` command is run.

.Activity Diagram for creating Progress objects when assigning a Student to a Course
image::Ivan-ProgressManagerAssignStudentToCourse.png[]

---
The flow of adding Progress objects in a AssignStudentToCourse is as follows

. If there are `Progress` objects that were previously in ProgressAddressBook but were removed due to an `Un-assign/Delete` command, add those `Progress` objects back in.
.. This only occurs when undo-ing an `Un-assign/Delete` command.
Refer to <<undo-assign-command>> for more information.
. Else, i.e. if this is an entirely new AssignStudentToCourse command,
.. Obtain *C'*, a copy of the targeted `Course`
.. From *C'*, obtain all assignmentIDs that are assigned to it.
.. For each of the obtained assignmentIDs, create a new CompositeID of assignmentID and studentID
.. Create a `Progress` object using each of the `CompositeID`
.. Finally, add these `Progress` objects into the `ProgressAddressBook`.

Notes

- The flow is largely the same for AssignAssignmentToCourse!
Instead, we want every `Student` that is currently studying in course *C'* to complete the particular `Assignment`.
Hence, rather than obtain all assignmentIDs, we will need to obtain all
`studentIDs` that are studying *C'*, and create a `Progress` object so that we can track whether those students have completed the assignment.
- The flow is also largely the same for UnassignCommands!
Instead, we are looking to remove Progress objects rather than adding them back in.

The table below shows the summary of method calls from `ProgressManager` for each variant of `Assign`/`Un-assign` command.

.Table Summary of ProgressManager method calls() for Assign/Un-assign Commands
image::Ivan-ProgressSummary.png[]

==== Marking Progress as `Done`/`Undone`
====== +++<u>Rationale</u>+++
When a `Student` finishes an `Assignment` that is allocated to him, you want to be able to mark his work
as `Done`.

Similarly, if an `Assignment` has been mistakenly marked as `Done` or is actually `Undone`, you want to be able
to mark the `Assignment` as `Undone`.

====== +++<u>Current Implementation</u>+++
.Sequence Diagram for Progress Manager's Handling of Done Command
image::Ivan-SequenceDiagramDoneCommand.png[]

The implementation of `Done` command is very straight-forward. Only 2 parameter is needed - assignmentID (aid) and studentID (sid).

. Create the CompositeID of `Progress` objects using the aid and sid
. Using this newly created compositeID, call modelManager#get(ID id, entity.type)
.. This returns a `copy` of the `Progress` object - P'.
. Execute `P'#done()`
.. If `P'` is already done, an exception will be thrown
.. Else, `P'` will be set its internal boolean isDone to be true.
. Save the edited `Progress` object to model
. Save the edited `Progress` object to storage

With this, the implementation of `Undone` command is about the same, we just have to call `P'#undone()` instead.

====== +++<u>Design Consideration</u>+++
There is 1 main considerations when implementing `Progress` objects.

1. Is there a need to separate `Assignment` and `Progress`?

. Implementation 1 - Have `Assignment` hold 1 `StudentID` and a 1 `isDone` boolean
Pros::
.. Simple to implement
Cons::
.. Memory-intensive since every student can have up to N number of `Assignments`
.. Suppose that a field in the `Assignment` needs to be updated, the program needs to loop through every single `Assignment` object
to update that particular field, resulting in high computational costs.
.. With an additional link from `Assignment` to `Student`, it will be require more work to maintain the correctness of the linking.
... In <<entity-linking,`Section 2.3`>>, the decided implementation was to *centralize all links around `Course`*.
... Hence, if another type of link was to be introduced, another `manager` will need to be implemented.

. Implementation 2 (Current Implementation) - Separate the logic of `Assignment` and `Progress`.
`Assignments` just need to hold its ID, name and deadline while `Progress` will handle whether a `Student` has completed that `Assignment` or not.

Pros::
.. Intuitive and simple to understand
... In-line with Object Oriented Programming since it can be modelled as a real world object.
... As most people have been through school, they can understand that when given a homework/assignment in school,
there is actually only *1* `Assignment` that *every* `Student` has to complete. This idea is basically what we have implemented.
.. Solves the first disadvantage of Implementation 1. Any time the details of the `Assignment` is changed,
the details will be automatically changed for all `Progress` objects.
.. Works well with current implementation of AddressBookGeneric which has `getters` and `setters` via `ID` since every `Progress` object will have its own `ID`
Cons::
.. Also very memory intensive

// end::progressmgmt[]

=== Undo/Redo [Hieu]

Currently we only support undo/redo for commands that modify the storage (or state of the app).
I.e add / delete, assign / un-assign, edit commands.

View Controller (LogicManager) will hold UndoRedoStack class, which stores the undoStack and redoStack which will be explained below.

Those commands listed above will inherit from UndoableCommand abstract class.
UndoableCommand will extends from Command class.

UndoableCommand will contain the general algorithm flow for doing undo/ redo, while there will be some details delegated to the actual command class.
This technique is also known as template pattern.

[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    public abstract void preprocessUndoableCommand() {}

    public abstract void generateOppositeUndoableCommand();

    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand();
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        preprocessUndoableCommand();
        generateOppositeUndoableCommand();
        return executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}
----

Note that for each UndoableCommand, before execution, it needs to save some information (through the preprocessUndoableCommand) then generate (and store) the opposite corresponding command (through generateOppositeUndoableCommand)

Let's go through the example in diagram below.
- The user first executes a new UndoableCommand delete-student.
Before this delete command is executed, we preprocessUndoableCommand to get the to-be-deleted student object, as well as the current index of this student object in list.

- Then we will generate a AddStudentCommand (which is opposite of this DeleteStudentCommand) with this studentObject and index and push it to undoStack

- When undo command is executed, the top of undoStack is popped out, then pushed to redoStack.
Then the oppositeCommand of it will be excecuted (in this case AddStudentCommand will be invoked)

- When redo command is executed, the top of redoStack is popped out, then pushed to undoStack.
Then the originalCommand will be executed (again) (in this case it will be DeleteStudentCommand again).

image::UndoRedoStack.png[]
---

* Design Considerations:
1/ How Undo and Redo works:
Option A: Save the entire app state after every command.
Pros: Very easy implementation.
Cons: Serious memory performance issue when storing the whole address book at every time step.

Option B (Current choice): Each (undoable) command will know how to generateOpposite command itself.
Pros: Reduce a lot of memory issue.

Cons: Harder to implement

// tag::OppositeCommandForEdit[]

==== Opposite Command for edit [Dat]
In EditCommand class, method `preprocessUndoableCommand` to get the toEdit Object and edited Object.

.Activity Diagram of Pre-processing for Edit commands
image::ActivityDiagramEditCommand.png[]

Method `executeUndoableCommand` will set the toEdit Object in the ObjectAddressBook to the edited Object.

Method `generateOppositeCommand()` will generate another `EditCommand` (which
is opposite to this EditCommand) with editing information of the original toEdit Object and push it to undoStack.

When `undo` and `redo` commands are executed, the process is carried out as described above.


// end::OppositeCommandForEdit[]
// tag::undoassigncmd[]

[[undo-assign-command]]
==== Opposite command for assign/ un-assign [Tee Jun Jie Ivan]
Generating of opposite commands for assign and un-assign commands is very intuitive. The opposite of assign is un-assign and vice versa.

The *tricky* part comes after you un-assign a Student/Assignment from a Course and have removed the affected `Progress` objects.
When you want to undo the un-assign command, you need to add back those particular `Progress` objects which were just removed instead of adding new `*undone* Progress objects`.
This is because those removed `Progress` objects may or may not be `done`.

This is achieved by 3 simple, additional steps.

. When pre-processing an un-assign command as per <<Preprocess-entity, `*Step 1 of Section 2.2.2*`>>,
you'll need to assign all `Progress` objects that are about to be removed to a variable.
. When `GenerateOppositeCommand` is called, via an overloaded constructor,  you will need to instantiate a new `Assign` using the `Progress` objects that you have saved:
[source, java]
public AssignAssignmentToCourseCommand(AssignDescriptor assignDescriptor, Set<Progress> undoProgresses)

.. This allows the opposite command to add back the removed `Progress` objects
. Finally, when `executeUndoableCommand` is executed, seeing that the undoProgresses is not null,
the `Assign` Command will add those `Progress` objects back. Please see the activity diagram below for a better understanding of when the
Undo Progress will be added back in.

.Activity Diagram of executing executeUndoableCommand of Assign Commands
image::Ivan-ActivityDiagramAssignUndo.png[]
---

This results in the *correct* `Progress` objects, which may or may not be `Done`, to be added back in instead of completely new `Progress` objects that are all `Undone`.

You can also notice that this is a faster implementation since we do not need to re-create a `CompositeID` and the actual
`Progress` object itself when we are just adding back the UndoProgresses.


// end::undoassigncmd[]

==== Opposite command for add/ delete (and maintain the corresponding links between entities)

`AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand` extends from abstract class UndoableCommand. Thus, user can undo/ redo this command.

In `AddCommand` class, method `preprocessUndoableCommand` get the toAdd Object and an index (if available).

Method `executeUndoableCommand` will add the toAdd Object to the ObjectAddressBook.

Method `generateOppositeCommand()` will generate a `DeleteCommand` (which
is opposite to this AddCommand) with toDelete Object is a clone of toAdd Object and push it to undoStack.

In `DeleteCommand` class, method `preprocessUndoableCommand` get the toDelete Object and its index.

Method `executeUndoableCommand` will delete this toDelete Object from the ObjectAddressBook.

Method `generateOppositeCommand()` will generate an `AddCommand` (which
is opposite to this DeleteCommand) with toAdd Object is a clone of toDelete Object and push it to undoStack.

When `undo` and `redo` commands are executed, the process is carried out as described above.

For `DeleteCommand`, it is important to ensure that entity links are removed properly.
For `AddCommand` generated by `generateOppositeCommand()`, it is important to restore all the entity links properly.
Therefore, in order to ensure undo/redo successfully, all 3 managers must be involved to manage all entity links.

When an object is deleted (Student/Teacher/Course/Assignment), `EdgeManager` will invoke a `DeleteEntitySyncEvent`
signal and a `DataStorageChangeEvent` signal to be handled by `StorageManager`. `generateOppositeCommand()` will
generate an add-command with a clone object of deleted object and stacked into undoStack.When an `undo` command is
executed, this `add-command` is pop out from the stack and executed, adding the cloned object with all the
information of the deleted object. The flow after add-command called now can be generalized as the previous
delete-command. All the entities links are restored.

=== View Switching [HIEU]
To see sub-view details of each section we can issue a select command.
Let's see an example of how selecting sub-view data of a student 1 works.

image::ViewSwitchFlowDiagram.png[]
---

. `select sid/ 1` command is issued to `ViewController`
. `ViewController`  will call `ViewModel` method `updateStudentDetailsMap`
. In turn, that method will invoke managers from `Model` layer, for example `ModelManager`,
to update `observableStudentDetailMap` inside `ViewModel`
. Because `StudentDetailsMap` implements an `onChange` function that
listen to update in `observableStudentDetailMap`, the UI part will be updated correspondingly
with data of this student 1.

Design considerations:

. Automatically updating the UI sub-view when the app state changes. Let's say the current sub-view
shown in the UI is of the details of student 1, then some information of the course of that
student is changed, or the student is removed from the course, the UI should update immediately
without the need to issue the click command again. To support that, our `ViewModel` will listen to `EventsCenter` , then whenever
an event of `DataStorageChangeEvent` or `DeleteEntitySyncEvent` happens, it will check
which `observableMap` (which corresponds to different `DetailedView`) is active then
do the query again.

. Lazy loading: For example, when seeing details of the students, we only want to show the courses
that the students have without the progresses of this course that the student currently have.
To query that, after executing `select sid/ student_id`, the user needs to run
`select sid/ student_id cid/ course-id` as well


=== Managing Staff Feature [Dat]
==== Implementation
This feature is implemented with the main classes - `Staff`, with a permission level specifying `Teacher` and `Admin`.

[source,java]
----
public class Staff extends ModelObject {
    public enum Level {
        TEACHER,
        ADMIN
    }
    //...
}
----
One of the features is to display all the `courses` that a `teacher` is teaching.

Another feature is to keep track of salary payment for `teacher`. A `teacher` is paid by teaching a course and the amount
is taken from the salary of the teacher. The payment will automatically have records of respective course and teacher ID.

To pay for `admin`, user has to do it manually using miscellaneous `FinanceType`.

Certain approaches have some certain pros and cons. It depends on how the user want to keep track of payment and method to pay to `teacher` and `admin`.

// end::Staff[]

// tag::xue5[]
=== Tracking Miscellaneous Payments/Earnings, Teacher Payments and Student earnings [Sim Sheng Xue]
==== Implementation

image::FinanceDiagram.png[]
Finance type `Miscellaneous` or `m` add command will add a `Finance` with a given Name (description) from the user.
The amount is sign sensitive, meaning miscellaneous can take in a positive amount or a negative amount corresponding to
earning or expense depending on the user.

Miscellaneous transactions can either be payments or earnings,
such as purchases of stationary or
advertisement revenue. Teacher payments are tracked by courses,
where the teacher is paid for each course taught. Student earnings
are also tracked by courses, where the student pays for each course taken.

Finance type `Miscellaneous` or `m` will create a Miscellaneous transaction,
where the `Amount` is specified by the user.

Finance type `CourseTeacher` or `ct` add command will access `CourseAddressBook` and `StaffAddressBook` to ensure `Course` and
`Staff` exist and make sure this staff is teaching this course. The `Amount` is set to the amount of the `Course`
(student fee).

Finance type `CourseStudent` or `cs` add command will access `CourseAddressBook` and `StudentAddressBook` to ensure `Course` and
`Student` exist and make sure this student is taking this course. The `Amount` is set to the amount of the `Course`
(student fee).

All three Finance types will create a `Finance` object to store the transaction,
which will be saved in the `FinanceAddressBook`.

=== Navigation among command history in the command box [Sim Sheng Xue]
.Activity diagram of Command History
image::CommandHistory.png[]
Coding Camp X supports quick navigation among command history in the command box.
Whenever the user executes a command, it will be added to a stack. If the command
fails to execute or is exactly the same as the previous command executed,
it will not be added to the stack. +

The user can click the [UP ARROW] or [DOWN ARROW] keys in the command box
to navigate through the executed command history. Since the implementation
for [UP ARROW] is similar(as seen in the activity diagram), this guide will explain
[DOWN ARROW] in details.

When the user clicks the [DOWN ARROW], the application will check
if the Right Stack is empty. If the Right Stack is empty, this means
that there is no commands below to navigate to. In this case, the command
box will still show the initial command.(No change) +

Else if the Right Stack is not empty, the next command will be popped
from the top of the Right Stack. Now, two actions will occur in parallel.
The command will be added to the Left Stack, and this command will also be
shown in the command box. This allows the user to navigate back to
the command after with an [UP ARROW] key command. The process will then
come to an end.
// end::xue6[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Assigning/ linking 2 entities

All assign command variants (i.e `AssignTeacherToCourseCommand`, `AssignStudentToCourseCommand` extends from `AssignCommandBase`
instead of the abstract `Command` class.

The diagram below shows a simplified flow

.Structure of Commands and Parser
image::AssignCommandImplementation.png[]
---

=== Design considerations:

- Since all assign commands are just linking between two entities, where each of them is distinguised based on its ID and its entity name (e.g course, student, teacher, etc).
So we have AssignDescriptor which stores this information.

- A factory design pattern to select which assign command based on the AssignDescriptor content.
