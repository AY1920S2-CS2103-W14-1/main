<p>Code Camp X (CCX) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage the administrative tasks of running a coding camp. More importantly, CCX is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CCX can allow you to manage your camp’s administrative tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added initial code base for the <strong>four main features</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pull requests <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/46">#46</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What it does: implemented the major functionality needed for each of the <strong>four main features</strong>.
This includes the fields needed for each features such as ID and course fee amount, Add, Delete, Edit, Clear, Find, List.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the initial code base allows us to work on each of our
own assigned features with fewer code conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects the commands to be added in the future, hence it sets the initial
code base needed for future features to be built upon. This implementation is especially challenging,
because alternative design implementations need to be considered, and numerous commands are added to the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the GUI alone</strong> over <strong>three</strong> iterations</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pull requests <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/45">#45</a>(First iteration), <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/73/commits">#73</a>(Second iteration),
<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/117">#117</a>(Third iteration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First iteration: added four different <strong>tabs</strong> to the GUI, displaying Student, Staff, Course and Finance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second iteration: updated the GUI to look like our initial mock-up. Changed color schemes and added Summary Panel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third iteration: revamped the GUI by improving the color schemes further. Added sub-panels in each tab.
For example, the Student tab now has an additional selected Student panel, along with a panel showing the list of courses assigned to the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can see clearly the effects of the changes made in the GUI
This implementation is especially challenging, because of the amount of effort taken to plan how the GUI should look like,
and ensuring that the GUI is suitable for every member of the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement also supports the clicking of the GUI. For example, the Student bar can be clicked to show the list of course assigned to the student. Every GUI interaction can be be replicated using a CLI command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added assigning commands (which forms the crux of designing our application) for the <strong>four main features</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pull requests <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/81">#81</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-W14-1/main/pull/91">#91</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the assigning of students/teachers/assignments to courses
This includes the GUI support mentioned in the previous section. For example, as students can be assigned to a course,
each course will have a list of students. This must be supported by the GUI as well, where the course tab
will display the list of students assigned to the selected course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because assigning of the various items
is the most important part of our application. This implementation is especially challenging, as the design implementation
needs to be considered carefully due to the large amount of potential one-to-one relationships. After the discussion
with the team about the code structure, I implemented the assigning commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement is tedious, due to the potential of bugs appearing. The design
implementation must be considered carefully. For example, when the user deletes an assignment, the assignment
should be removed from every course that the assignment is assigned to. Also, the assignment
must be removed from every student that is taking a course with this assignment. As can be seen,
the user commands will cuase significant changes to the relationships among the <strong>four main features</strong>,
which have to each to notified of the changes made. The GUI must also be updated
automatically when the user performs the command, in every tabs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added the support of a summary panel which displays the overall statistics of the coding camp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a quick navigation command that allows the user to switch between different tabs quickly (Select command and CTRL+UP/DOWN shortcuts)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.</p>

<img src="../images/ViewUI.png" alt="ViewUI">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Structure of the UI Component</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UI consists of a <code>MainWindow</code> that is made up of parts e.g.<code>CommandBox</code>, <code>ResultDisplay</code>, <code>StatusBarFooter</code> etc.
All these, including the <code>MainWindow</code>, inherit from the abstract <code>UiPart</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>UI</code> component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching <code>.fxml</code> files that are in the <code>src/main/resources/view</code> folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>UI</code> component,</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Executes user commands using the <code>ViewController</code> component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listens for changes to <code>ViewModel</code> data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
<code>ListPanel</code> objects store a list of <code>Card</code> objects.<br>
<code>DetailedPanel</code> objects store a list of <code>VeryDetailedCard</code> objects.
For example, for the Student Tab: <br></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>StudentListPanel</code> is the top left panel. This stores a list of <code>StudentCard</code>,
which only displays the basic information about the Student.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>StudentDetailedCard</code> is the top right panel. This is viewed when a specific
Student is selected using a command. This will show the detailed information about
the Student, such as the courses assigned to this Student.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>StudentDetailedPanel</code> is the bottom
right panel. This stores a list of <code>CourseVeryDetailedCard</code>.
Each <code>CourseVeryDetailedCard</code> displays the list of assignments assigned
to the Course of this Student.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only the Student and Course tabs contain <code>DetailedPanel</code>(bottom right panel). All tabs
contain the <code>ListPanel</code> (top left panel) and <code>DetailedCard</code>(top right panel).
This is because <code>ListPanel</code> is needed to show the basic information of each
item, while <code>DetailedCard</code> is needed to show the detailed information of each
selected item. <code>DetailedPanel</code> is only needed for Student to show list of Courses for a Student,
and for Course to show list of Student for a Course.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>As can be seen from the UI diagram above, each of the <code>Card</code>, <code>DetailedCard</code> and <code>VeryDetailedCard</code>
will subscribe and listen to the <code>ViewModel</code> through the logic layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of these classes will correspond to the observableMap in <code>ViewModel</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there is a change to the model, the <code>ViewModel</code> will update its observableMap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As each of these classes in <code>View</code> subscribe to the <code>ViewModel</code>, the UI will update automatically.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The command execution can affect the <code>Model</code> (e.g. adding a student).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>LogicManager</code> will invoke the relevant class located inside <code>Model</code>.
For Entity CRUD commands, the <code>ModelManager</code> will be invoked.
For Link CRUD commands, the <code>EdgeManager</code> will be invoked.
For Progress CRUD commands, the <code>ProgressManager</code> will be invoked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Managers will post events to the <code>EventsCenterSingleton</code>. The subscribing
managers <code>DetailManager</code> and <code>StorageManager</code> will listen to new publish events in the event bus.
The <code>View</code> also subscribes to <code>DetailManager</code>. This allows for the commands executed by
the <code>LogicManager</code> to moify both the View and Storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a <code>CommandResult</code> object which is passed back to the <code>View</code>.</p>

<li>
<p>In addition, the <code>CommandResult</code> object can also instruct the <code>View</code> to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.</p>

<p>The <code>StorageManager</code> subscribes to the <code>EventCenter</code>. It will listen to
both DataStorageChangeEvent and DeleteEntitySyncEvent. DataStorageChangeEvent occurs
when basic information about each object is changed, except for deletion.
DeleteEntitySyncEvent occurs when an object is deleted, and the storage has to
be update to maintain consistency. For example, when a Course is deleted,
the DeleteEntitySyncEvent will trigger the storage to remove the Course from
every Student assigned to this Course.</p>

Each ModelObjects should have a ID generated that is unique among the entire application, across history.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Finance object can represent a Student paying for a Course. When the Student is deleted,
the Finance object is not deleted. This is due to the need to track the Finance of the coding camp,

can delete the Finance object).<br></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coding Camp X supports quick navigation among command history in the command box.
Whenever the user executes a command, it will be added to a stack. If the command
fails to execute or is exactly the same as the previous command executed,
it will not be added to the stack.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user can click the [UP ARROW] or [DOWN ARROW] keys in the command box
to navigate through the executed command history. Since the implementation
for [UP ARROW] is similar(as seen in the activity diagram), this guide will explain
[DOWN ARROW] in details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the user clicks the [DOWN ARROW], the application will check
if the Right Stack is empty. If the Right Stack is empty, this means
that there is no commands below to navigate to. In this case, the command
box will still show the initial command.(No change)<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Else if the Right Stack is not empty, the next command will be popped
from the top of the Right Stack. Now, two actions will occur in parallel.
The command will be added to the Left Stack, and this command will also be
shown in the command box. This allows the user to navigate back to
the command after with an [UP ARROW] key command. The process will then
come to an end.</p>
